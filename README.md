SpreeLocationPrioritizer
=============

Spree 3.0 has the priotitizer to sort the package capability but not implemented.
This gem/extenstion assume every stock location has its own serving countries and priorities.
Example, stock location with priorities as {"ca" => 1, "all" => 0, "us" => 10000} , and location with prioties as {"ca" => 10000}
The second location should serve Canadian customers when possible.

The coordinator will put all items into one package and ship from one warehouse. It will will not check the on_hand_count. If you want remove one item away from one stock location,
delete it from the item location lists, not just set the on_hand_count to 0.
