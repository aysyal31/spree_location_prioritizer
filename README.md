SpreeLocationPrioritizer
========================

Introduction goes here.

Spree has variant locations and prioritizer in its stock packaging
However this priritizer is not implemented, though it could be customized.
This gem address one common user case, that inventory locations usually server by geography locations.
After installing this gem, you can set the package destination (country iso code)
It adds one new field in stock_locations and will use that field to sort the packages.

The priority defination example is:
de={"ca" => 1, "all" => 0, "us" => 10000}
de is the location, it can ship to country CA, US and all other countries.
assume we also have another location
nwb={"ca" => 10000}
If we have two packages to Canada, one from de and another from nwb, the one from nwb have higher priority and will be sorted as the first
